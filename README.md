### Short summary of results
1. Between 2012 and Q3 2014, 88475 transactions were carried out:
* 34128 in 2012,
* 33023 in 2013
* 21324 in 2014 (up to Q3)
2. There are:
21 countries,
7 order method types,
8 retailer types,
5 product lines,
21 item types,
144 different products
3. Year by year there is increase of profits in each country.
3. Year by year there in almost every country mean price is falling or rising minimally.
4. In 2013, compared to 2013, in each contry there was an increase in sales of products, except France, where was a minimal drop in sales. No complete data for 2014 (only up to Q3).
5. Most of the most expensive products (price above 351.62 money units, 10% of the most expensive products) were sold in: USA, France, Canada, Japan, Germany.
6. Most of the least expensive products (price below 6.65 money units, 10% of the least expensive products) were sold in: USA, Japan, France, Germany, Canada.
7. By far the most products were sold through the website. The website also generates the biggest profit, the biggest profit per order. However, the website does not generate the greatest profit per unit sold. It means that the most expensive products are not sold with this method of making an order.
